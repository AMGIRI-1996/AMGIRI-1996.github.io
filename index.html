<p>My love story with the programming world started from <span style="color:blue">Blue screen </span> right from school days. 
    A physics enthusiast felled for coding games in c++ to create interesting platforms, help build AI solutions, to even own a complete startup product. 
    The story has been amazing and I still love every bit of it. 
    Always eager to learn new things, new technologies, new ways, and learn new styles from different people.
 </p>

 <p>
    I own the complete development of two startups, right from designing to completely making it work all by myself.
</p>
<p>Currently, I am a Senior R&D Engineer at <a href="https://www.wadhwaniai.org">Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence</a>, 
    an independent, non-profit research institute and global hub, developing AI solutions for social good. 
    I am currently leading engineering teams across multiple projects in the healthcare and agriculture domains.
</p>
<p>I have previously worked with Qualcomm where I led different projects and came up with some cool tools and products. I have also worked with a startup in my final year where I built their payment system, on-web calling feature which wasn't common at that time in India.</p>
<p>Prior to that, I obtained my B.Tech at <a href="https://www.nitdelhi.ac.in/">NIT Delhi </a> 
    where I founded dCoders the Coding club of NIT Delhi, through which we organized lots of competitions, inspired students, and helped them grow.   
</p>

<p>
    I have worked on lots of projects in lots of technologies. Technology is never a barrier for me, for me it's a weapon to create beautiful and amazing things.
    In the majority of projects I have led the work or owned it completely. Always love to inspire people and get best out of them.
    </p>
