<p>Skilled Engineer in various scientific programming tools and have a strong grounding in engineering, design and research. My interest is in exploring ways to improve the lives of people in developing countries with well-designed technological interventions.</p>
<p>I am working currently as Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.wadhwaniai.org">Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence</a>, an independent, non-profit research institute and global hub, developing AI solutions for social good. I have previously worked with startup focused on AR/VR camera applications and SDKs, drone data analysis and was also founding engineer at a startup in the home improvement space where I worked on building web based solutions that leveraged classical ML models.</p>
<p>Prior to that, I obtained my B.Tech at <a href="https://www.nitw.ac.in/">National Institute of Technology Warangal (NIT Warangal)</a> where I founded an award (Design Challenge by <a href="https://www.isb.edu/en.html">Indian School of Business Hyderabad</a>) winning startup which built a real time position reporting system for buses without using GPS.</p>
<p>I am also a robotics enthusiast and was a Fellow at Teach for India. Always an aspiring polymath!</p>
<p>My CV can be found <a href="../resume/">here</a>.</p>
