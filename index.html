<p>I am a Research Fellow at <a href="https://www.wadhwaniai.org">Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence</a>, an independent, non-profit research institute and global hub, developing AI solutions for social good. My ongoing projects include using AI in agriculture and healthcare domain and we aim to build solutions for scaled impact.</p>
<p>I graduated with major in Electronics and Electrical Engineering and minor in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.iitg.ac.in">IIT Guwahati</a> in 2019. For my undergraduate thesis, I worked with <a href="https://www.iitg.ac.in/anand.ashish/">Dr. Ashish Anand</a> on using deep learning to compress long strands of DNA information into meaningful lower dimension features and identify signals or motifs which influence the splicing phenomenon. This work was accepted at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/icml-compbio-2019/home">ICML 2019 Workshop on Computational Biology</a>.</p>
<p>I am broadly interested in Machine Learning, Vision, ML Engineering and Computer Systems.</p>
<p>In the past, I have worked on Image Contrast Enhancement in an internship at Computational Vision and Fuzzy Systems Lab, Hanyang University, South Korea, under the supervision of Prof. Frank Chung-Hoon Rhee. Also, I did a summer internship at NVIDIA where I worked with the GPU Performance Verification Team for improving latency analysis in the performance simulation environment.</p>
