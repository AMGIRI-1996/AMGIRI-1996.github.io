### `While at Wadhwani AI`


#### Pest Management

`Django React Docker AWS EC2 s3`

It is an AI-powered early warning system available through an app on Android smartphones. It helps farmers protect their crops by determining the right time to spray pesticides through immediate, localized advice. 
Along with the app, a web-based dashboard supports program implementation with a real-time (as well as historical) view on the pest occurrences in monitoring plots as well as the village.

#### Serveflow
`Pytorch Django Docker AWS ECS s3`

It is an internal platform used for deploying ML models in production. This platform serves models in production for a solution. A solution can have multiple models in production and which one to serve can be decided by the solution owner.

#### Annotation Studio
`FastAPI Apache Airflow React admin Docker Cognito s3`

As it's name suggests, it is an internal platform for annotations. Any person with the right credentials can check, trigger, and validate annotations for a solution. 
This is a platform independent solution so, services of any annotation provider can be used. 
Different solution can have different and multiple annotators. Solution-specific workflows can be added and monitor progress of an annotation job.

#### Data Ingestion
`Cognito Cloudformation Cloudfront SES Lambda React s3`

This is a data migration solution used by third parties/ stake holders to migrate the data securely in secured place. 
It smartly solves a lot of problems smartly by using cryptography, AWS services in best way possible. This makes this solution very lightweight and it costs minimal to nothing.
It is secured and very easy to use for external entities. The best part is that it requires little to no engineering (it takes just 5-15mins) while onboarding a new project.

#### Cough Against Covid
`Pytorch, Flask, React`

Our solution enables screening for Covid using only solicited cough sounds. The AI is trained on cough sound data collected from Covid-positive and negative patients at hospitals in Bihar, Odisha, Rajasthan and Maharashtra.

### `While at Qualcomm`

#### DeepScope 
`Tensorflow Flask Jinja2 Material UI`

This was an AI solution to find the root cause of a crash. This AI solution was trained on huge past crash logs and their solutions to find the most relevant area of chip where a crash would have happened. It reduced the time for finding the correct team from 5-7 days to minutes.

#### Q/A Platform
`Docker Flask Jinja2 Material UI`

This platform was used internally by employees for questioning and answering queries within the organization. More like stackoverflow but internal as these things can't be shared on public platforms. It had similar features like stackoverflow.

#### Smart Assembly Code Viewer
`Python`

This UI application was built in order to save time, read assembly code easily, and get information on a click away in place of going through docs.
As internally specially developed assembly language was used, there was no platform or help available. This had some special features like converting Assembly code into C code, getting Flow chart of a function, get mnemonic information on a click.

### `While as General Secretary (Coding Club) at  NIT Delhi` 

#### Clash Of Codes
`Web Technologies PHP C++`

A web platform on which a user will submit `one player AI code` to play a game and he will be able to compete with other player's AI code. Portal will simulate the board game and will let each AI play it's move and show this with animation.
The platform was made game independent and a virtual tournament can be played among all players. This was quite a success in the back days. [Open Source](https://github.com/AMGIRI-1996/Clash-Of-Codes) 

#### Treasure Hunt 
`Android Studio QR Scanner`

Real time treasure hunt, in place of actual cheats we developed an app to scan a QR code to get clues right on their app and at the same time track all teams progress.

### `While as Graduate student at NIT Delhi`

#### semantic similarity between sentences of any language (natural or computer)
`Zang & Shasha's Algorithm Java Regression`


The project was to get the similarity between two sentences of any language (It can be natural language or computer language).
The first step we are doing is to parse the sentence and get the tree structure of it. Then, applying Zhang and Shasha's algorithm (we modified it as pure algorithm was not appropriate here) to find tree distance between these parsed trees and used regression to find out the weight of a tree in a sentence. [Proof of concept](https://github.com/AMGIRI-1996/ZangShasha)

#### Operating System with Sanskrit Instruction set
`VHDL`

This was final year project for B.Tech. We designed the complete hardware architecture of a very simple Operating System which was able to take input from the keyboard and display output on screen.
The instruction set was completely in Sanskrit and hence we can call it as a Sanskrit operating system as not only the top layer of OS is in Sanskrit, but it is complete Sanskrit Operating System. [Proof of Concept](https://github.com/dCodersNITD/SanskritOS)


There were a lot more projects I developed while at NIT Delhi. Complete list with details can be found at [this link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anurag-giri/details/projects/)
